## Overview
This MCP server provides intelligent tools to explore two powerful APIs to build effective Transport Management Systems:

### 1. Omelet Routing Engine API
Advanced routing optimization solutions including:
- **Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP)**: Classic and advanced VRP optimization
- **Pickup & Delivery (PDP)**: Optimized pickup and drop-off routing
- **Fleet Size & Mix VRP (FSMVRP)**: Multi-day fleet optimization
- **Cost Matrix**: Distance and duration matrix generation

### 2. iNavi Maps API
Location services including:
- **Geocoding**: Convert addresses to coordinates
- **Batch Geocoding**: Process multiple addresses efficiently

## Important Notes
### Regional Limitation
The OSRM distance_type for auto-calculation of distance matrices is currently only supported in the Republic of Korea. You can still use our optimization engine by providing your own distance matrix.
